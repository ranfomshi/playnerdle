        <p>play nerdle today. Playnerdle.com gives you a wordle style game but with unlimited practice mode. </p>
        <img src="..\images\nerdle.png" /> The whole idea behind nerdle is to allow people to play multiple times per day rather than having to wait until the next day. You can still however play the daily challenge still so you get the best of bothe
        worlds and you can share your results with your friends and family. Love words? Get your nerdle on. Nerdle is the way forward for those looking to improve their linguistic skills If you want to switch to the unlimited practice mode you can use
        th toggle above the guess box and beneath the nerdle title. But switch back to daily challenge or refresh the screen at any point and your game will be where you left it, whether you guessed today's nerdle challenge or not...yet.

            <h2>Social</h2>
            <p>I'm not going to pretend like you are going to have word game parties or that word games will make you super popular at school or college but they are a great way to get to know people. Some of my earliest memories are playing Scrabble with
                my gran and watching a gameshow called Countdown with my family. According to swaay.com, You can gather new or old friends and play together in teams, which will make you all bond. Socializing has a lot of mental health benefits. It can
                improve your mood, according to research. There are various mental and physical health benefits for socializing, such as stress relief and relaxation.

            <h2>Concentration</h2>
            <p>Concentration is a skill. And like with any skill, the more you practice the better you get and it can help with any other task that requires concentration. Just like conditioning a muscle. I always remember the old saying, "use it or lose
                it!".

            <br>
            <h2>Relaxation</h2>
            <p> Modern life brings with it a lot of stress and tension that needs relieving. Word games can result in hits of <a style="background:lightblue" href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-dopamine#:~:text=Dopamine%20is%20a%20type%20of,in%20how%20we%20feel%20pleasure.">Dopamine</a>,
                which is party responsible fro how we experience pleasure. You may have also noticed noticed how you can end up getting lost in a word game like Nerdle, where youare so focused that you can have a moment away from all of life's other stresses.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
            <p>The Nerdle dictionary of "answers" is around 5000 5 letter words. I am a qualified teacher and when I tried to think of how many 5-letter words I knew, I got a few hundred before I really started to struggle and had to rely on things like
                pluralised 4-letter words. So if a seemingly well-educated adult can stretch their vocabulary then I'd say pretty much anyone can. Furthermore, Nerdle will try to retrieve the word origin for you (if you guess a real word).
